# HashTables
Within a Java class, write a method that creates n random strings and inserts them in a hash table. The method should compute the average time for each insertion.
2. Write another method that finds n random strings in the hash table. The method should delete the string if found. It should also compute the average time of each search.
3. Repeat #1 and #2 with n = 2i, i = 1, â€¦, 20. Place the numbers in a table and compare the results for Cuckoo, QuadraticProbing and SeparateChaining. Comment on the times obtained and compare them with the complexities as discussed in class.
